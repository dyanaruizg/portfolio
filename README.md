# Personal Portfolio Project

This project is an opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout the WEB 425 Angular with TypeScript course to create a professional portfolio website. I showcase my work, skills, and experience to potential employers or clients in this portfolio. It allows me to demonstrate what I have learned and am capable of in a way that a resume alone cannot.
