      <h1>Hi!<br>I'm Diana Ruiz Garcia</h1>
      <h3>Brief introduction to myself.</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a computer systems engineer specializing in software. My focus
        is building and managing websites and web applications. I am a
        very resourceful and ambitious person at the same time. I find
        solutions, am creative, and solve problems without needing help
        from colleagues or bosses. I know when to ask for help and take
        my time when needed. But when it is possible to take care of
        something without taking up other people's time, I do it and
        consider myself very good at it.
